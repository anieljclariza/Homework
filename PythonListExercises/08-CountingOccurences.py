# 8. Counting Occurrences
# Exercise: Given the list letters = ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'a', 'd'], count how many times the letter 'a' appears in the list.

letters = ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'a', 'd']
letter_count = letters.count('a')
print("The letter 'a' has appeared in the list", letter_count, "times.")
